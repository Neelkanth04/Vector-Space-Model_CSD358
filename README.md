Vector Space Model Search Engine 🔍This is a ranked retrieval search engine built from scratch in Python for the CSD358 Information Retrieval assignment. The system uses the Vector Space Model with an lnc.ltc weighting scheme to rank text documents from a corpus against user queries.✨ FeaturesVector Space Model: Implements the lnc.ltc cosine similarity ranking scheme for accurate document ranking.Positional Index: Builds a positional index to store the exact location of every word, enabling advanced search features.Phrase Search (Novelty Feature): Allows users to search for exact phrases by wrapping their query in double quotes (e.g., "information retrieval").Soundex Algorithm: Includes a phonetic matching algorithm to find terms that sound alike, which is great for handling spelling variations in names.Full Text Preprocessing: A complete pipeline for text normalization, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and Porter Stemming.Modular Codebase: The project is organized into five distinct modules for clarity and maintainability.📂 Project StructureThe code is split into five logical Python files:main.py: The main entry point that runs the program.preprocessing.py: Contains all functions for cleaning and normalizing text.soundex.py: Contains the implementation of the Soundex algorithm.indexer.py: Responsible for reading the corpus and building the search index.search.py: Contains all logic for query processing, ranking, and scoring documents.🚀 How to RunFollow these steps to get the search engine running on your local machine.1. PrerequisitesPython 3.xpip (Python package installer)2. SetupClone this repository to your local machine.Place all your .txt document files inside the corpus folder. If the folder doesn't exist, please create it in the main project directory.The script will attempt to install the nltk library automatically if it's not found. However, you can also install it manually:pip install nltk
3. ExecutionNavigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.Run the main.py script:python main.py
The program will first build the index from the documents, run two pre-defined test cases, and then start an interactive search loop.💡 UsageOnce the program is running, you can type your queries directly into the terminal.Free-Text Query: Simply type your search terms and press Enter.query> zomato business account
Phrase Search: To search for an exact phrase, enclose your query in double quotes.query> "ancient family"
